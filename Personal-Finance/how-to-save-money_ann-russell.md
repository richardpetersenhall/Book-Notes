## Budgeting
- Before you can save money you first need to be able to see what you are spending.
- Write everything down on paper or in a spreadsheet what you are currently spending. 
- Make sure you are separating out properly so don't group expensive carrot-and-wensleydale sandwich into the grocery section. 
- Look at every single item on your list: is it necessary, or just convenient?
- Colour code each entry - green for essentials, yellow for things you need to consider, red for stuff you can eliminate. 
- Budgeting is similar to dieting - it's easy enough to deny yourself all pleasures for a week, but harder over a longer period. 
- Organise your money by having two separate bank accounts. One for wages and main expenses coming out automatically. the second to use for day to day.
